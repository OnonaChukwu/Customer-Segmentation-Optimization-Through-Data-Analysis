## Hypothesis and Research
- **Hypothesis:** Customers can be segmented into distinct groups based on their purchasing patterns, which correlate with demographic factors and spending behaviors.
- **Research Questions:**
  1. How do demographic factors influence purchasing behaviors?
  2. What are the characteristics of high-value customers?
  3. Can customer loyalty scores predict spending?
  4. What impact does visit frequency have on spending?
  5. How do purchasing behaviors correlate with the customer value?

## Methodology
- **Data collection:** Utilized an e-commerce dataset (strongly modified to ensure data privacy) containing customer demographics and transaction details.
- **Data Analysis:** Applied clustering techniques to segment customers based on their behaviors and traits.
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas for data manipulation, and scikit-learn for clustering analysis.

## Results and Interpretations

- Focusing strategies for high-loyalty categories is neede.
- For example, categories with higher loyalty scores could be focused on to achieve this.
- See electronics, investing in exclusive deals, better customer service, and expanded product ranges to help capitalize on this high loyalty.

- There is no strong relationship between these variables; non neither depends nor influences each other!

- Tailored marketing would be useful to adjust marketing influence based on product category affinity among customers
- To specifically target customers more effectively, enhance their overall experience and loyalty among them.

### How does customer behavior vary by demographic?

- Younger age groups (18-25) and females tend to purchase more but spend less per transaction.

- Older groups, particularly between 46-65 spend more per transaction, but purchase relatively less.

- Tailored marketing strategies can be adjusted to target each demographic effectively among these customers.
- E.g., for younger groups, focus on volume via promotions, while for older groups, focus on high-value products.

- Adjust stock levels and promotions based on the popularity of product categories within each demographic.
- E.g., if electronics are popular among males and fashion items among females in marketing campaigns.
- Engage different age groups with strategies tailored to their preferences and spending behavior.
- E.g., Loyalty programs for older customers who spend relatively more is highly recommended.

### Can we predict future purchase behavior based on past activity?

- Both models provide insights into how well they can predict future purchasing behavior based on the features provided.
- The linear regression (4.9) significantly outperforms the decision tree (5.0) model (as seen by a lower MSE); there is a clear non-linear relationship.
- Key predictors like Visit_Frequency and Customer_Loyalty_Score could be particularly influential, which can guide strategies to enhance these aspects.
- This is a speculative suggestion though, and should be applied with cautions!

### What are the common segments of customers and how can marketing be tailored to each?

- My result represents a clustering of customers into three groups based on various attributes.
- Cluster 0 and 1 are younger and older customers respectively, with similar purchase counts.
- Theri average spending is around 70USD (younger and older), and a comparable customer value of around 346USD.
- Cluster 2, which has a middle-age average, notably differs by having a much higher average spending per visit.
- Specifically, it has 297USD, and a significantly greater customer value of 1488USD; a potential lucrative group.
- Therefore, this group might be the most lucrative target for marketing strategies if well optimised.

- Now for a segment that scores high in loyalty but has lower spending, introduce referral bonuses to increase their spending and bring in new customers.
- For high-value customers, personalized shopping experiences or dedicated support lines could enhance satisfaction and increase their lifetime value.

## Conclusions
- Distinct customer segments identified exhibit significantly different spending patterns and values.
- Demographic factors like age and visit frequency significantly influence purchasing behaviors.

## Recommendations
- **For Cluster 0 and 1:** Introduce loyalty programs and referral incentives to increase engagement and spending.
- **For Cluster 2:** Implement personalized marketing strategies such as customized offers and premium services to enhance customer retention and value.
